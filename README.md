The original environment design, logic, and core training loop structure were created by CodeAndAction. My work focuses on restructuring the reinforcement learning pipeline (e.g. rewriting the agent in PyTorch, refining the DDQN architecture, improving experience replay, adding proper epsilon scheduling, etc.). All credit for the base simulator concept goes to CodeAndAction. This repository is an extension of the original work.
